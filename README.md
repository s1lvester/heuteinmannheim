Heute in Mannheim
===============

Simple webscraping project to gather events in my local town of Mannheim,
Germany. Heavily inspired by the awesome website http://heuteinstuttgart.de

Written in Python 3 it creates static html to enable low-end or free
hosting. Accordingly heuteinmannheim.de is hosted right here on github-pages.

Status is somewhat beta but far from feature-complete.

Licence is MIT

Stay free, stay open-source!
